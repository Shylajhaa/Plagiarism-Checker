Password is the first stage of defense for any application. But if there is a password then there is definitely a way to crack it. So in order to increase the integrity, we use special symbols and characters. Further we introduced finger print scanner and iris scanners to, but they aren’t efficient since they add extra hardware and cannot be integrated to all devices. This can be evident in the recent activities like IRS Vikram Indian submarine details being leaked to china. Another infamous incident was the hacking of the account of Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.

	Our project aims in introducing the time parameter to the password in order to make it strong and more secure and relieve the user from such malicious discrepancies. This feature increases the strength of the password by 1 followed by 1000nd 0s which is around 600! To 700! (!-factorial).This also deals with the recovery methods and special features that deal with unauthorized accesses (hackers). The versatility of the project is pliant as it can be adopted in simple smart phones to National servers.

	The front end of our project is developed using JavaScript and the back end uses SQL. The goal and scope of the project involves incepting and enhancing national level security for classified information. Finally, the flexibility of the project is diverse as it can be implemented in any domain.
