As the saying goes “Necessity is the mother of invention”, it is ‘searching’ that has become the substrate for any innovation. This ‘searching’ has become the primary aspect that has lead to boom of the ‘Internet’. To plan a trip or to find a person, the internet search has become very vital.
The present trend is to find the required information on the websites. As we all know Google is the most efficient search engine for retrieving useful information for a search keyword. For every Search engine the top results are displayed for the user with millions of results .
	Our project aims to develop a search engine that extracts search results of the request keyword from top search engines and displays the top links. To increase the probability of user satisfaction, the displayed links are sorted using ranking algorithm- counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. This algorithm works on the basic assumption that websites receive more links from other websites. Users Access internet and fetch information from different Web sites. The approach to find information from websites is a difficult task. To ease the process of searching  information over the websites, by giving search keywords, software assistance is required. The search engine software ensures the end user to get the information by accessing the websites specified in the database.
Our project is developed using HTML (front end), Java, and SQL(back end). The main goal of the project is to select among billions of websites, the results of three search engines and  display them to the users. We aim to display top ten results of the website. Thus the project completes as the basic version of the idea.
