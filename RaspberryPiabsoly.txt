From what began as a machine to do complex tasks; computers have now become an essential part of our lifestyle. Technological advancements have made computers smaller and smaller and today we have computers that could easily fit into our palm. In this paper, we showcase the newest addition to the world of computing, a computer that is slightly bigger than a credit card, the Raspberry Pi, and how it could revolutionize the way our next generation learns programming.
It has been designed to be efficiently interfaced with the following components: camera, gertoard, HAT expansion boards. The main reason of using Raspberry Pi is that it is very much basic and cheap at the same time it can have a greater hardware performance, memory capacity and enormously a large amount of peripheral device support. It is a fully programmable PC that runs a free, open-source Linux operating system, plugs into any TV, can power 3D graphics, connects to the Internet and, with a little ingenuity, be used to create your own personalized robot slave. The computer's miniature frame is crowded with two USB ports, an SD card slot, an Ethernet connection and microchip in the middle -- all powered by a universal USB mobile charger. The Raspberry Pi could very well help programmers to learn the system architecture and also create their own games for their enjoyment.
